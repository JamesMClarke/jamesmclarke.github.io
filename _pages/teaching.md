## Lecturing
#### Invited lecturer: Usable Security and Privacy (IY5617) - Royal Holloway, University of London - 2024-2025
In this module, I worked with Dr Maryam Mehrnezhad, to deliver a lecture focusing on research related to Usable Security and people with Disabilities.  
## Demonstrating
Alongside my PhD at the University of Surrey, I have served as a demonstrator for various modules including Secure Systems and Applications (2022-3, [COMM047](https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2022-3/module/COMM047/)), Advanced Challenges in Web Technologies (2023-4 & 2024-5: [COM3014](https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2023-4/module/COM3014/SEMR2/2CF)), Information Security Management modules (2023-4 & 2024-5: [COM3017](https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2023-4/module/COM3017)), Privacy Enhancing Technologies(2024-5: [COM3030](https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2024-5/module/COM3030)), and Ethical Hacking and Pentesting (2024-5: [COM3031](https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2024-5/module/COM3031)). During these roles, I have worked both independently and as part of a team to support students learning in classes of up to 200 students. Additionally, I have worked to update and refine lab materials for a number of these modules.
