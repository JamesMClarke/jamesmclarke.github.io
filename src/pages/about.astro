			<p class="m-0 text-ink text-2xl font-semibold leading-tight">I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Surrey and Durham University. My research focuses on the security and privacy of assistive technologies, particularly for people with visual impairments.</p>

			<p class="m-0 text-muted">My work sits at the intersection of usable security, web accessibility, and privacy. I study how the design of everyday web technologies — cookie notices, browser extensions, screen readers — can fail the people who depend on them most, and what can be done to fix that. This includes large-scale web measurement, accessibility evaluation, and privacy engineering.</p>

			<p class="m-0 text-muted">My published research includes a study on the accessibility of cookie notices across top UK websites, combining automated accessibility testing, assistive technology evaluation, and a user study of 100 participants with visual impairments. That work, published in ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing, found that the majority of cookie notices contain accessibility issues and provided recommendations for developers, policymakers, and tool designers. I have also completed a large-scale analysis of browser extension ecosystems, examining tracking behaviours, security risks, and their impact on web accessibility.</p>

			<p class="m-0 text-muted">I actively collaborate with industry and non-profit stakeholders to translate research into real-world outcomes. I serve on the Security Advisory Group for NV Access, advising on the security and privacy of the NVDA screen reader, and have contributed security expertise to the Tech Abuse Handbook. I also review for journals and conferences including the International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, PLOS ONE, and venues affiliated with IEEE EuroS&P.</p>

			<p class="m-0 text-muted">Beyond research, I am involved in teaching across multiple institutions. I deliver invited lectures at Royal Holloway, University of London, and demonstrate across a range of security modules at Surrey. I previously served as Technical Officer for the Newcastle University Cyber Society.</p>
